## Project Breakdown

### General Overview (Ideas that can be implemented)

![General Overview](https://github.com/taniamukherjee/Assignment_betterworld/blob/master/image/data_view.jpg)

1. Overall picture of the statistics of kiva loans all over the world(eg: loan_amount, gender split, activity, sectors, etc)

2. Have a base world map which can be zoomed on each continent and be able to click on each country which would pop up the existing statistics on Kiva data Countrywise (eg: loan_amount, most_active_sector )

3. Kiva growth over the years (Number of loans/Total loan amount over the years, stacked by sector)

4. Gender disparity by regions (Map) & sectors, overall growth through time(Pie/bar/line charts)

5. Overall number of loans, sum of loans, Loans by sector (different layers in map) 

6. Timeline (animated)â€¦ Loans by time , color coded by sector, size by loan amount.

7. Have a base world map which can be zoomed on each continent and be able to click on each country which would pop up the existing statistics on Kiva data Countrywise (eg: loan_amount, most_active_sector )

### Story Telling

![Story Telling](https://github.com/taniamukherjee/Assignment_betterworld/blob/master/image/storytelling.jpg)

1. Show correlation between gender and kiva loans and come up with other correlations (we will work on this using tableau and come up with insights)

2. Where could the money lended by lenders be efficiently utilized ? (Measure by growth/poverty)

3. Deeper look at Philippines, Kenya & Peru (Top 3 by number of loans) By sector, activity, repayment. Scrape local news        around the time of much increase in loans (Is it Kiva popularity or is it the need?) . 

   Deeper look at Last three, budding regions. Scope for more funding? (How much do they need really?)

   Mid three? How can we improve ? Do they need? (Verify with poverty index )

4. Lending to teams vs Lending to individuals, in what all sectors does it make a difference? 



### Possible Prediction/Machine Learning Applications

![Machine Learning](https://github.com/taniamukherjee/Assignment_betterworld/blob/master/image/DL_multilayer.jpg)

1. Predict where could the money lended by lenders be efficiently utilized (to be decided)

2. Will a loan money returned, be refunded into other loans?? (How to maximize refunding? Where they refund ? same sector?) 

3. How many borrowers might come forward to fulfill a new loan?

4. Group the loans or borrowers into clusters by Unsupervised learning techniques and identify top n features (K-Means)
